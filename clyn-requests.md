# List of Requests from Clyn

1. Add "Questions" to group naming to make it more clear. Maybe I should call them question sets.
2. Make the grid/board that displays all the questions to choose from during the game.
3. Attach an image, video, or soundclip to questions (has to do with specific question, not referring to the grid)
4. Manually change the amount of points that the teams have.
5. Prebuilt Themes + customization options for colors, styles, shapes, sizes, grid icons.
6. Themes for the displaying grid icons, this is selected in the session settings.
7. Add modes, random mode, would be set in game settings and grid mode.
8. Add randomn events to grid. ex: Team loses X number of points. It should be a % instead of a set number. % can be based on where the team is at on the leaderboard, both for positive and negative events. It should factor in what how many possible total points and turns are left in the session, and how big the point gap is between teams.
